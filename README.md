# ColorSense

1. What is the proposed name for your Web application?
    - ColorSense
2. Who is the target audience for your Web application?
    - Ordinary people who want to have better color match in daily life(choosing clothes etc) or work(design keynote/ppt etc).
3. What problem is it intended to solve for the target audience?
    - When you go out for an important meeting, do you get the right color tie? When you prepare a PPT or Keynote, do you select a good palette for your topic? 
    People might say color match is so complicate that only fashion designers care. And even designers take months to study a lot palettes to decide their ideal ones.
    - Inspired by the way that professional designers study palettes, I want to present people a service recommending them "good" palette based on their pictures.
    Extract colors of user-upload pictures, compare them with good palette dataset, rate them with similarity of a good palette, show similar palette recommendation.
    - Learning from similar "good" palette, people can adjust their color selection with a little effort and get a big improvement in terms of color match.
4. How will it meet the minimum project requirements?
    - Users need to create their account to use the service.
    - Users upload their pictures to get similar palette recommendation. These records are stored for them.
    - Users can delete past uploads.
    - Probably use 3rd party API to extract image property.
    - Probably use 3rd party API to import "good" palette examples.
    - Show recommendation result to users by self-defined functions. 
5. Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?
     - My site recommends palettes to users according to their original works. First, people get a simple start. 
     No hassles to study good palettes, or fashion magzines, or label the colar values. Just take a picture, upload it and wait for recommendations.
     Second, they get improving suggestion based on their original works. They do not need to change a lot to get a good match.
